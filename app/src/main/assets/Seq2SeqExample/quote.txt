Genius only means hard-working all one's life.
Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value.
Cease to struggle and you cease to live.
A strong man will struggle with the storms of fate.
Do you love life ? Then do not squander time, for that's the stuff life is made of.
Every noble work is at first impossible.
Living without an aim is like sailing without a compass.
Great works are performed not by strength, but by perseverance.
A contented mind is the greatest blessing a man can enjoy in this world.
You make the failure complete when you stop trying.
